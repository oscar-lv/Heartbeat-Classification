# Heartbeat Classification

This project explores how different neural network models perform heartbeat classification using an ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset on Kaggle.com (Fazeli, S. 2018). It is comprised of two well-known collections of signals, the BIT-MIH Arrhythmia Dataset (MIT.edu., 2020) and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database (Bousseljot, R., D. Kreiseler, and A. Schnabel, 1995), each split into five and two categories, respectively. We will refer to these as MITBIH and PTBDB from this point onwards.
